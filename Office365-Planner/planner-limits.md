# Microsoft Planner limits

This article describes the current limits that apply to Microsoft Planner.

## Plan limits

|Field  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|
|Maximum active tasks in a plan    |2400|
|Maximum buckets in a plan    |200|
|Maximum plans owned by a user     |200|
|Maximum plans that a user can delta-sync     |300|

|Maximum users that can delta-sync a plan    |100|
|Maximum contexts on a plan    |10|
