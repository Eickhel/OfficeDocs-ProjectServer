title: Licenses for customizations of Project for the web
description: Custom solutions built on Project for the web require licenses when used with the Project solution. Your custom solution itself should also have some kind of license, but you might want to make it as freely-available as possible to encourage others to build on your work.

# Licenses for customizations of Project for the web

When you create custom solutions starting with Project for the web, keep in mind what licenses are required. There are three considerations:

- People who manage projects
- People who view projects
- Licenses of your custom solutions

## Prerequisites

- The ability to purchase and assign license as need
- A basic understanding of customizing Project for the web

## Project for the web licenses

Your custom solution may be distributed under whatever license you want. However, using it with Project for the web requires licenses obtained from Microsoft.

[!INCLUDE [p4w-licenses.md](includes/p4w-licenses.md)]

## Licensing your custom solutions

[!INCLUDE [p4w-solution-layers.md](includes/p4w-solution-layers.md)]

It's up to you what licenses your custom solution uses. If you want others to build on your solution, consider using some kind of free or open-source license.

For example, [the PMO Accelerator solution](enhance-project-for-the-web-projects-use-accelerator.md) is distributed free of charge under the MIT license. This enables others to create their own custom solutions that include parts or all of the PMO Accelerator, under the terms of that license. Note that doing so doesn't grant licenses to use any part of Project itself&mdash;that's governed by the [Project for the web](#project-for-the-web-licenses).
