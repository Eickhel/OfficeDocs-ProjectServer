# Begin using Project for the web while supporting Project Web App

Project for the web is the interface for projects that are based on the Project Power App. This article explains how projects in Project for the web differ from projects in the Project Web App, and provides links to help you decide which projects will work better in Project for the web.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [appropriate licenses](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq).
- Understand [the basics of the Power Apps portal](/learn/paths/get-started-power-apps-portals).

## Summary of differences between Project Web App and Project for the web

Project for the web offers some substantial benefits over Project Web App, but doesn't yet offer full feature parity. The following table can help you understand the differences.

| Functionality | In Project Web App | In Project for the web | Summary of differences |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Storing project data** | SharePoint tables | Dataverse tables and columns |  |
| **Presentation of project data** | Project Detail Pages | Views and Forms |  |
| **Logical flow of projects** | SharePoint workflows | Power Automate |  |
| **Securing access to projects** |  | [Security roles](project-for-the-web-security-roles.md) |  |

## Storing project data



## Presentation of project data

Both Project Web App and Project for the web projects present data using instances of project templates that you customize. People working on projects use a browser-based interface. But the interfaces and the design experience are different.

### Project Detail Pages in Project Web App

For Project Web App projects, you control and customize data presentation with Project Detail Pages by using Project Online or the Project Desktop client. Changes you make to Project Detail Pages affect all the projects in the same tenant.

### Views and forms in Project for the web

For projects in Project for the web, you use the Power Apps Portal to edit the Project Power App

### The Information form: the default Main form of the Project Power App

When you open a project in Project for the web, the browser displays the Main form&mdash;typically the *Information* form, which is the default in Project for the web. All projects created in Project for the web in the same environment display the same Main form.

When you open the Project Power App in an environment, you can set a different default Main form, and you can also edit forms. Both changes affect all projects in that environment, providing centralized control over the functionality of projects.
