# Create a managed solution to add the Power BI template to the Project for the web Accelerator

The [Project for the web Accelerator solution](deploy-project-for-web-accelerator-power-bi-template.md) gives you a head start customizing Project for the web to support common project management scenarios. It's a managed solution, making it easy to deploy new versions as updates.

We encourage you to further customize Project for the web to better meet your specific business needs, and we advise that you do so by creating your own solution to layer on top of the deployed Accelerator. One enhancement that's ready to go is the Power BI template for the Project for the web Accelerator. This article provides guidance for adding the Power BI template to your managed solution to deploy on top of the Accelerator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The order of events in this process is critical:
>
>  1. Select (or create) a development environment where you're an admin, and where Project for the web and the Accelerator solution are deployed&mdash;or deploy them, if they aren't there yet.
>  2. Download the Power BI template and deploy it to that development environment.
>  3. In that environment, create a managed solution that contains the steps to integrate the Power BI template (along with any other customizations you might want).
>  4. Export the solution, and then import it into your production Project+Accelerator environment.

## Prerequisites

- Admin rights in a development environment [with the Project for the web Accelerator deployed](deploy-project-for-web-accelerator-power-bi-template.md)
- Power BI Desktop and a Power BI Pro account
- Rights to use the Common Data Service connector
- An understanding of [managed solution layers](/power-platform/alm/solution-layers-alm#layering-within-a-managed-solution)
- (Optional, but recommended) A [Developer plan](/power-apps/maker/developer-plan) so you can export your solution to easily deploy in other environments.

## Deploy the Power BI template

1. Download the [Power BI template](/OfficeDev/Project-Accelerator#heres-the-latest-version-of-the-power-bi-template-for-the-accelerator).
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
1. Select **File** > **Import**, then select the downloaded template.
1. When prompted for the environment url, use the base url of your development environment. For example: `https://mydevenvironment.crm.dynamics.com`
1. Not the workspace where you save the report.
1. To [ensure that your team will have access to the report, share it](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards).

     - On the [Power BI portal](https://app.powerbi.com/), in the navigation pane select **Workplace** and then select the workspace where you put the report.
     - In the report's row select the three vertical dots to open the menu, and then select **Manage permissions**.
         :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-sharing-choose-pbi-rpt-1.png" alt-text="Open the Power BI template report menu":::

     - Under **Related content**, expand **Datasets**, and then select the report.
         :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-sharing-choose-pbi-rpt-2.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

     - In the **Grant people access** dialog, enter the email addresses of the Teams groups who need access, select the sharing options you want, and then select **Grant access**.
         :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-sharing-options-pbi-rpt.png" alt-text="Sharing options for granting access to the Power BI report":::

         > [!NOTE]
         > You might want to repeat this process for several different groups, to control who can do what with the report in Project for the web.

## Create a managed solution for customizing Project for the web and the Accelerator

To customize the Project Power App after deploying the Accelerator, create a new managed solution that contains the customizations, and then layer that solution over the Accelerator.

Like the Project Power App, the Accelerator is a [managed solution](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm) so that Microsoft can make future improvements and fixes, and so customers can deploy such changes as upgrades to their environment. Although you can customize the environment after you deploy the Accelerator, this might cause issues if you then try to deploy an update.

> [!TIP]
> If you're a beginner to managed solutions, visit [Application lifecycle management (ALM) with Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/alm/) to prepare before your first try.

1. Select or create a development environment with Project for the web and the Accelerator deployed.
1. In the navigation pane of that environment, select **Solutions**, and then on the command bar select **+ New Solution**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-new-solution.png" alt-text="Start a new solution.":::

1. Add a **Display Name**&mdash;the solution will bear this name in environments where it's deployed.
1. A value for **Name** will then appear. It's safe to accept this value, but you can change it provided you don't use any invalid characters.
1. If you already have a [solution publisher for your custom solutions](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-solution#create-a-solution-publisher), use it for **Publisher**. If not, create one to use:

    - In the **New Solution** dialog, under **Publisher** select **+ New publisher**, complete the dialog that opens and then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-new-publisher.png" alt-text="Add a new publisher for your custom solutions.":::

1. Adjust the **Version** if you want, and then select **Create**. Your new solution opens.

> [!TIP]
> For more options when you create a custom solution, go to [Create a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-solution).

### Example customization: add an action to send email when a Project Request is approved

The cloud flow included with the *Project Requests* scenario is very simple: it creates a project from a request when *Request State* is set to *Approved*. By adding an action to the cloud flow, you can make it also send an email notification.

1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and select your development environment.
1. In the list of solutions, select **Project for the Web Accelerator**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Cloud Flows**.
1. Select **When the request state is updated to Approved** to open it.
1. On the command bar, select **Edit**.
1. Select **+ New step**.
1. Under **Choose an operation**, enter *Out* and then select **Office 365 Outlook**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-add-ol-connector.png" alt-text="Add the Outlook connector to your new flow step.":::

1. Select fields inside the connector to add content. Power Apps offers suggestions depending on the field you select. For example, when you select the **Subject** field you see attributes you can add. When the flow runs, the value of the attribute appears in the generated email.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-ol-action-subject.png" alt-text="Power Apps suggesting attributes for the email Subject line.":::

1. Your Outlook step should look something like this example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-ol-action-ready.png" alt-text="Example Outlook step in a customized cloud flow.":::

1. Save and close the flow.
1. On the command bar, select **Publish all customizations**.

### Disable the flow

1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**, and then select **Project for the Web Accelerator**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Cloud Flows**.
1. Select the **When the request state is updated to Approved** flow. Then, on the command bar select **...** and then select **Turn Off**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-turn-off-flow.png" alt-text="Turn off the flow":::

1. On the command bar, select **Publish all customizations**.

## Modify the Project Accelerator â€“ Reports menu to use the deployed template or any Power BI report

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must first [deploy the Power BI report to PowerBI.com](#deploy-the-power-bi-template).

When you deploy the Accelerator, the Report menu points to a web resource file with instructions on how to get the Power BI Template with the Accelerator. Because the Accelerator is a managed solution, this web resource cannot be edited. There are two options to have the report bring up the Power BI report.

### Option 1: Add a dashboard with the Power BI embedded report

1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select the environment where you created your customized managed solution.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select your customized managed solution, and then on the command bar select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-project-accelerator-edit-solution.png" alt-text="Edit the selected solution.":::

1. In the navigation pane, select **Objects**.
1. On the command bar, select **New** > **Dashboard** > **Power BI embedded**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-embedded-report.png" alt-text="Add a Power BI embedded dashboard to your custom solution.":::

1. In the **New Power BI embedded Dashboard** dialog, enter a **Display Name**, then select a **Power BI workspace** and **Power BI report**, and then select **Save**.
1. Add the *Project* site map to your custom solution.

     - On the command bar, select **Add existing** > **More** > **Site Map**
     - Select the item with the **Name** *msdyn_ProjectServiceCore*, and then at the bottom of the dialog select **Add**.

1. Select the **Project** site map, and then on the command bar select **Edit**.
1. Select **Reporting** > **Reports**.

     - Set **Type** to **Dashboard**
     - For **Default Dashboard**, select the Power BI report, and then on the command bar select **Save and close**.

1. Select **Publish**.
1. Open Project for the web, and in the navigation pane select **Reports**
1. The Power BI embedded dashboard now appears.

    :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-in-app-dashboard.png" alt-text="The Power BI report for the Accelerator, displayed in Project for the web.":::

### Option 2: Add a Web resource that embeds the Power BI report (full frame)

The Accelerator includes a placeholder for the Power BI template. Once you've deployed the Accelerator and the Power BI template, follow these steps to have the Power BI report appear in the Accelerator.

1. Once you've deployed the Power BI template, open the report in [PowerBI.com](https://www.powerbi.com).
1. Select **File** > **Embed Report** > **Website or portal**.
1. Copy the link labeled **Here's a link you can use to embed content** and keep it handy.
1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select the environment that contains the Accelerator.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**, then select your custom managed solution, and the on the command bar select **Edit**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Objects**.
1. On the command bar, select **New > More > Web resource**.
1. Enter the following values:

     - **Display Name** = *Accelerator Power BI report*
     - **Name**: *Accelerator_report*
     - **Type**: *Webpage HTML*

1. Create a new HTML file to upload with the following text, but change the value of **src** to the powerbi.com link you copied in step 3 of this procedure.

     ```html
     <html>
     <head>
     </head>
     <body onfocusout="parent.setEmailRange();" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">
      <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="REPLACE THIS" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

1. Select **OK**.
1. If it's not already there, add the *Project* site map to your custom solution.

     - On the command bar, select **Add existing** > **More** > **Site Map**
     - Select the item with the **Name** *msdyn_ProjectServiceCore*, and then at the bottom of the dialog select **Add**.

1. On the command bar, select **Publish all Customizations**.
