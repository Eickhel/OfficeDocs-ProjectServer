## Overview
  
![Project Online.](media/276154dc-3e4e-49db-9a4d-67f037094c25.png)

**[Project Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=402127) is web-based and great for:** 
- Managing multiple projects
- Tracking work on timesheets
- Balancing broad resource needs
- *(If you're looking for a hosted version of Project Server, this is it!)*
   
 **Project Online is NOT a web-based version of Project Professional.** Project Online is an entirely separate service that offers full portfolio and project management tools on the web. It includes Project Web App, and can, depending on your subscription, also include Project Online Desktop Client, which is a subscription version of Project Professional.

## Manage your subscription

 **If you need to cancel and subscribe to something else,** select **Billing** \> **Subscriptions** in the Microsoft 365 admin center, choose the subscription you want to cancel, and then select **Cancel subscription** in the pane on the right. You can then find the product you want to subscribe to and add it to your existing Office 365 account.
